# WordRainServer
WordRain Game Client Server Version

This is a Java arcade style game made as a project for the Advanced Object Oriented Programming class of Nova Scotia Community College Marconi Campus (Information Technology Web Development year two semester one). This version is a client/server version. The client and server communicate by sending and receiving commands.

The goal of the game is to type in the words falling from the top before they hit the bottom or hit the player. The word to type next is located on the players head. If the player is hit, points are lost, but if the player is hit four times, it's game over. If the player makes it to the end, they can enter their name and score into a database. Use the arrows to move left and right.
